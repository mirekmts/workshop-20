## Main steps

Please find the proposed agenda below - what we will build step by step.

### App Core

- [ ] run the project
- [ ] make a simple change and observe how the results change
- [ ] a few words about development/production "builds"

### Pseudo-scenes / main states / navigation

- [ ] what is a React Component?
- [ ] creating and including a simple component ("Next Button")
- [ ] "props" - what it is?

- [ ] making a "transition" -> adding a click event

### Adding dependencies - material-ui / styling

### Adding dependencies - axios / API Service

- [ ] installing the dependency
